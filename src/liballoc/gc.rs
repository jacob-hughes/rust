/// A garbage collected pointer.
///
/// The type `Gc<T>` provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
/// allocted in the heap. `Gc` pointers are `Copyable`, so new pointers to
/// the same value in the heap can be produced trivially. The lifetime of
/// `T` is tracked automatically: it is freed when the application
/// determines that no references to `T` are in scope. This does not happen
/// deterministically, and no guarantees are given about when a value
/// managed by `Gc` is freed.
///
/// Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and `Gc` is no
/// exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to something
/// inside an `Gc`. If you need mutability, put a `Cell` or `RefCell` inside
/// the `Gc`.
///
/// Unlike `Rc<T>`, cycles between `Gc` pointers are allowed and can be
/// deallocated without issue.
///
/// `Gc<T>` automatically dereferences to `T` (via the `Deref` trait), so
/// you can call `T`'s methods on a value of type `Gc<T>`.
